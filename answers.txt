After the "ls > newfile.txt" command, the file "newfile.txt" was made within the directory. The ">" combined with the "ls" command appeared to create a file within the current directory that saved the names of all the contents of the directory into itself.

After running "git status", it is seen that "newfile.txt" was added as a new file and that the change was to be committed. 

After running "git diff", the terminal displays the contents of "newfile.txt". Notably, it is seen that the line "This is my file listing" is highlighted to indicate that it was a new change to the file.
